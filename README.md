# liri-node-app

# Overview
In this app I created a play on Siri with Liri.  It is a command line driven app throught terminal. Use any of the following requests followed by the appropriate search term or phrase to query the respective APIs to get a list of results.
* concert-this
* spotify-this-song
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says

The concert-this operation will search upcoming concerts related to a specific artist of your choosing

The spotify-this-song operation will search spotify for your chosen song and display information about the song, artist and album

The movie-this operation will query the OMDB API for your chosen movie

The do-what-it-says operation will read the text in the linked random.txt file and run whichever above operation and search phrase/term in the .txt file
